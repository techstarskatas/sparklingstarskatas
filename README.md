A “ghost kitchen” needs a system to allow users to have visibility of what items are available, purchase, and pick up items at any one of their points of sale.

Users: dozens of automated fridges and representative run kiosks, thousands of customers.
Requirements:
Must integrate with 3rd party smart fridges to obtain inventory and purchase activity
Smart Fridges Produce item inventory levels and purchases. The smart fridges have a cloud based management system that handles communication with the Smart Fridge so obtaining this data would be through an API.
Must integrate with point of sale system at kiosks
The Kiosk is a sublet space inside another business where we will sell our product but have an employee to handle the transactions through a point of sale. The same data should be accessible through the POS systems API’s.
Mobile  Web accessible
Support providing feedback on items of verified purchases and in app surveys
Accept coupons and promotional pricing
Send inventory updates to central kitchen



Long term Goals
Long term would like to allow multiple vendors to offer items through points of sale
Wants to harvest data to provide personalized recommendations based on users health goals, purchase history, and item ratings
