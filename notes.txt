A “ghost kitchen” needs a system to allow users to have visibility of what items are available, purchase, and pick up items at any one of their points of sale.

Users: dozens of automated fridges and representative run kiosks, thousands of customers.
Requirements:
•	Must integrate with 3rd party smart fridges to obtain inventory and purchase activity
•	Smart Fridges Produce item inventory levels and purchases. The smart fridges have a cloud based management system that handles communication with the Smart Fridge so obtaining this data would be through an API.
•	Must integrate with point of sale system at kiosks
•	The Kiosk is a sublet space inside another business where we will sell our product but have an employee handle the transactions through a point of sale. The same data should be accessible through the POS systems API’s.
•	Mobile and Web accessible
•	Support providing feedback on items of verified purchases and in app surveys
•	Accept coupons and promotional pricing
•	Send inventory updates to central kitchen

Longterm Goals
•	Long term would like to allow multiple vendors to offer items through points of sale
•	Wants to harvest data to provide personalized recommendations based on users health goals, purchase history, and item ratings
